# Bayesian statistics

Introduction to Bayesian statistics for MSc Computational Methods in Ecology and Evolution at Imperial College London.

This repository includes all taught material in a series of jupyter-notebooks with R kernel in the ```Notebooks``` folder with the following order:

* Monday lecture:
- 01_thinking.ipynb
- 02_concepts.ipynb
* Monday practical:
- 03_genomics.ipynb
* Tuesday lecture:
- 04_priors.ipynb
- 05_inference.ipynb
* Tuesday practical:
- 06_population.ipynb
* Wednesday lecture:
- 07_computation.ipynb
- 08_MCMC.ipynb [optional, with python kernel]
* Thursday lecture:
- 09_ABC.ipynb
* Thursday practical:
- 10_speciation.ipynb
* Friday lecture:
- 11_networks.ipynb
* Friday practical:
- 12_ecology.ipynb 

This material should be used only by students from the aforementioned courses.
These notes and slides have been mostly based on "Statistical Inference", Casella & Berger, 2nd Ed.; "Bayesian methods for Data Analysis", Carlin & Louis, 3rd Ed.; "Probabilistic graphical models", Koeller and Friedman.

## Instructions

Follow instructions [here](https://irkernel.github.io/installation/) to install the R kernel for jupyter notebooks and [here](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE) to install RISE (if you wish so).
The following R packages are required: abc, coda, maps, spam, fields.

To open a notebook, type
```
jupyter-notebook
```
The first time you open a notebook, make sure you have a "clean" version by clicking on "restart and clear output" under the "Kernel" option.

Guidance on typing using markdown can be found [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
Likewise, a good source for latex formatting of mathematical objects is [here](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics).

## Readings

Additional papers can be found in the ```Readings``` folder.

## Self-assessment

In this file you will find a series of problems to solve to practice for the exam.


## Timetable

* Morning sessions (with some flexibility):
- 10 - 10.45
