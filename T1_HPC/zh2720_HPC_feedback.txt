Q 8 :    2 / 3    comments: the mechanism isn't postitive feedback as more abundant species are also more likely to lose individuals. The answer is primarily related to stochasticity and the fact that extinctions cannot be reversed in a model without immigration or speciation

Comments...
In question 8 quite well worded, though not making the correct point
In question 12 good but could have been a bit more honed and it would be nice to mention *dynamic* equilibrium
In question 16 not such a detailed answer and would have been nice again to mention dynamic equilibrium more explicitly
In question 21 very good, but would be nice to explain the 'scaling factor' more clearly and show where the log comes from in the formula given
In question 22 
In question 23 would have been nice to mention the Sierpinski Gaskett explicitly
In question 26 not very clear, didn't quite explain why there was originally a problem with this function before the fix.
 
Marks for graphics quality :  6.5 /8
Comments...
In question 8 excellent
In question 12 it would have been nice to put the legend in the whitespace and maybe get rid of the grey lines but still the finished product looks excellent
In question 16 could have been really good but missing bar labels on the horizontal axis let it down
In question 20 excellent, you could put the bar labels on their side to fit them in the space better, but that's a minor point
In question 23 excellent
In question 30 good, but the axes, and particualrly the axis labels are not relevant here
 
Marks for code quality :  5.5 /8
Comments...
reasonably well commented but room for more, and some comments left in that were for debugging purposes only. A bit of other feedback on e.g. process_challenge_A_data() is that the number of repeats is hard coded at 100, it would be better to pass that in as a variable and then use it throughout the function.  They way it is now one could easily introduce a bug by wishing to change from 100 to 1000 but neglecting to update the number in one of the places where it is used
 
Marks for challenge questions :  9.4 /16
Comments...
challenge question A, excellent, though some minor improvements possible on the graphics - get rid of the grey and move the legend
challenge question B, excellent
challenge question C, excellent
challenge question D, good start but didn't plot the graph, compare to custer results or explain why coalescence is fast - so it was not a complete answer.
challenge question E, very good
challenge question F, not attempted
challenge question G, not attempted, solution used 0 characters in total, previous record: 154 characters
