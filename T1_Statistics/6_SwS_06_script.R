# Exercises (submit one word document per group):
#   1.	You are given a dataset by your PI, where an experiment has been 
#       performed where the growth of two groups of bacterial colonies (n each 
#       group = 300) has been compared. Your PI has found an interesting 
#       difference between both groups - to an effect size of 0.11, with a 
#       p = 0.044. The result is rather ground breaking, but the PI is worried 
#       that it might be a misleading result. The PI didn’t do a statistical 
#       power analysis, so they are uncertain about whether they had sufficient
#       power. The bacterial colonies have since died, because nobody could 
#       enter the lab for months due to a pandemic. Hence, to repeat the 
#       experiment would be very expensive and time consuming. Calculate the 
#       statistical power of this test. Then discuss in your group what the 
#       result means and how the PI should proceed. 
#   
#   2.	Write up a methods section that details what you have done and 
#       justifies your decisions. Then write a results section that details 
#       your results, and use tables and/or graphs to support your points. 
#       Then write up a conclusion section, where you must make one suggestion 
#       of how, and why, the PI should proceed. Submit one word document per 
#       group. 
#   
#   3.	Philosophical discourse: In your groups, discuss what the consequence 
#       of Type I and Type II errors are for the body of published literatures.
#       If one in twenty results may be a false positive or negative, then what 
#       does that mean for the whole body of literature? Discuss repercussions
#       and potential solutions. 
#
