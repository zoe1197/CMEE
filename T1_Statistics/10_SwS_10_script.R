## SwS 10 ##
# Exercises:
# 1)	Go to the website http://guessthecorrelation.com and play until you have 
#     a good “feel” for the correlation.
# 2)	Check out this visualization of variances and covariances. Discuss in 
#     the group how this visualization helps, and also, what it does not show.

# 3)	Find out how to produce a matrix of x,y scatterplots of multiple 
#     variables, histograms, and the correlation coefficient, like the one in 
#     the hand out pdf file. You can use the sparrow morphology data for it, 
#     or find your own data, or simulate your own data. Make one of these 
#     scatterplot matrices per group. Submit one pdf file with the graph, per 
#     group.
