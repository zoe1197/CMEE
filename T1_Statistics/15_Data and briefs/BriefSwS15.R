# Today is reserved for honing your skills! 
#   
#   I have prepared a number of datasets for you to explore. Please read through the briefs and pick one - some are real datasets from Josh and me, some are artificial datasets, some are datasets from your fellow students. I want you to pick one and really play with the data - re-do things we've done this week with that new data. Always follow this guide:
# 
# - check the data - is it clean to go to be analysed? If not - data wrangling and cleaning is your first step
# 
# - what is your research question? Think about that first. Then identify your response variable, and explanatory variable, and potential influential other variables. 
# 
# - the load your data and do some exploratory plotting
# 
# - explore the data structure
# 
# - conduct a full descriptive analysis
# 
# - then move on to your model. 
# 
# All along the way - do keep up the communication with me and the tutor - don't forget this is for you to deepen your knowledge!
#   
#   
#   
#   Once you've been through all this - streamline your script so that it's brief and only contains the elements a reader needs to see. Then I want you to record a short video in which you present your analysis strategy. If you want, you are welcome to submit a Methods and results section to the dropbox. You are free to do the video, and the submission, as a group, or as individual students - that's up to you. 
# 
# I will do my best to comment on them but with 150 students it will not be instant!

# Datasets:
# 
# - Morphometrics and reproductive data on individual unicorns
# 
# - A long-term, multi-year observational collection of insect presence data, collected by a volunteer
# 
# - A long-term data set on rodents in environmental factors in the Chihuahuan desert
# 
# - A dataset on invasive plants in Spain
# 
# 
# 
# Advice for picking a dataset:
# 
# Please pick a dataset you like but consider that some are harder to tackle than others. If you feel like you need to become more confident in your analytical skills, maybe best start out with the rodents, or the unicorns. If you are up for a really tough coding challenge, go for the real life dataset - the insects. Some of these I only received this week so haven't really had a chance doing much about them - they are as novel to me as to you. These are not "polished" and will need some cleaning up before you can do a reasonable analysis on them. That is difficult and maybe best left to ambitious coders - but you can use your skills learned in this and last week to tackle that.
