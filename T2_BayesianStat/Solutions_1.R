# what happened? it is convenient to use numbers in log-scale: log(a*b/c) = log(a) + log(b) -log(c)

# what is the effect of the prior here?

# PS: if you want to calculate proper probability (in log) you have to approximate the sum of logs, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_logarithmic_identities

# I) how would you calculate the genotype posterior probabilities assuming that the inbreeding coefficient is not known but it can have two possible values, 0 with probability 0.7 and 0.2 with probability 0.3?
