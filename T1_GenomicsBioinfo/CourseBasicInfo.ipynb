    "Convenors: Matteo Fumagalli\n",
    "\n",
    "Week: 6\n",
    "\n",
    "Dates: **2020-11-09 to 2020-11-13**\n",

    "## Description\n",
    "Population genomic data contain valuable information on how species relate to each other and how they evolved and adapted to their environment. As such, the study how genetic diversity within species is central to addressing many questions in evolution, ecology, and conservation. New sequencing technologies allow for the generation of large-scale genomic data which are pivotal for an understanding of population processes at deep resolutions. The goal of this module is to introduce students to the types of questions that can be addressed with population genomic data, and the theory and computational methodologies that are available for answering these questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Aims\n",
    "This module provides an understanding of:\n",
    "\n",
    "genomic data collection methods, and how to choose the data collection technique most appropriate to your question.\n",
    "the wealth of data available to biologists in public genomic databases.\n",
    "how genetic structure develops within and between populations and how to characterise it.\n",
    "how demographic history affects genomic variation, and how to infer past population expansions and contractions from genomic data.\n",
    "how migration affects genomic variation, and how patterns of gene flow can be inferred from genomic data.\n",
    "how natural selection affects genomic variation, and how selection can be identified from genomic data.\n",
    "## Reading\n",
    "(optional) Nielsen, Slatkin, 2013. An Introduction to Population Genetics: Theory and Applications. Oxford University Press, Oxford.\n",
    "\n",
    "A useful primer in genomics can be found here [Computational Genomics with R](http://compgenomr.github.io/book/). I advice students who didn't study biology in their undergraduate course to go over chapters 1.1 and 1.3 as a gentle introduction to some basic concepts of genomics we will discuss during this module.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Module delivery\n",
    "The content will be provided via online lectures and practicals. Lectures will be either live or recorded. Nevertheless, the online material will be available to all and will cover all content.\n",
